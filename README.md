Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) 3 -Layers, 1 Output Node

The primary objectives of this project are the following:

    1.) Demonstrate simple three layer fully connected (dense) neural network using the numpy lib implementing the math behind popular frameworks Kera, PyTorch  
    
    
    2.) Develop intuition for the predictive value of publically available dataset for forecasting the number of employees that leave the workforce by month
